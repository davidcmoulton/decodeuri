The two related posts linked to below are the writeup of my raw notes from Smashingconf Oxford 2016. I'll likely add to them as I come across errors, or can update with links to speakers slides or other resources. They contain my transcription of my hand-written notes I took while listening to the speakers. Their primary aim is to capture as much as possible while it's fresh in my mind. There's always a chance I've misunderstood something, or haven't represented something quite right because I didn't catch everything. If so, I apologise, I can only write so fast - and that's faster than I type! Speaking of which, forgive the typos. I typed up the notes as fast as I could, so they're a bit rough about the edges.

A huge thank you to all of the speakers, and to Smashing for organising it, it was another phenomenally good conference.
